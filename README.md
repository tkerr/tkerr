### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an engineering manager, embedded systems developer and amateur radio enthusiast.  

These repositories contain personal projects mostly in support of my amateur radio hobby. 
Many were designed to solve a specific problem and may not provide general purpose functionality. 
Feel free to use these as a starting point for your project and tailor them to your needs.
